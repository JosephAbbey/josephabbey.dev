  While Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) engineers are crucial contributors to the work
  L3Harris does, FPGA engineering is not widely acknowledged by school curriculums in the UK.
  Senior FPGA Consultant, Philip Abbey, was recently inspired to try and lower the barrier to
  entry for FPGA skills. Co-authored alongside his 14-year-old son, Abbey developed a
  ScratchVHDL toolkit designed to help educate comprehensive students about FPGA. The toolkit
  combines the theory of digital logic design with practical aspects using interactive tools,
  offering exercises from basic logic gates through finite state machines. So far, Year 12
  students within two local schools have trialled the toolkit with great success. Three more
  schools have since expressed an interest in exploring the toolkit further.
