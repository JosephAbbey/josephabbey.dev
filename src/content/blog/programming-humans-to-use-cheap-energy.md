An important part of optimising energy costs is making sure that humans use energy at the correct times.

Here are some simple rules that help to achieve this:

1. Limit energy use when the battery is low, and in the near future, energy will be expensive, with minimal solar generation.
2. Use lots of energy when the battery is full, or energy is cheap, or there is lots of solar generation (especially minimise exported energy).
3. Use energy when it is free (e.g. Octopus Free Energy Sessions).
4. When energy is expensive, and there is little solar generation, do not overload the battery (e.g. do not turn on the kettle and the toaster at the same time).

## Using an App/Dashboard

In my experience, simply making people aware of how their actions use energy has an effect on their behaviour; in the first case, simply having an app/dashboard that shows the current energy use, and people being interested enough to have a look at it, makes a difference. Part of the optimisation will happen without people even noticing as their intuition acts on the data presented. I should note that all the people in my sample (my household) are reasonably nerdy, so will naturally interpret data automatically, so this may not apply to everyone.

It is interesting how quickly humans learn from feedback.

I talk about my dashboard cards specifically in my [previous post](/blog/predbat-dashboard).

## Using Notifications

The problem with a dashboard is that people aren't always going to be looking at it. It can improve behaviour if people are notified when an important change should be made. Here is a set of notifications that I have found useful:

1. Large export of energy - you will always (usually) sell energy at a lower price than you buy it, so if you can use more energy instead of exporting it, you will save money.
2. Battery overload - if energy cannot be drawn from the battery quickly enough, to supply the load (`load - solar > battery max discharge`), then energy will be drawn from the grid, which costs money.
3. Energy is free - if energy is free, then it is a good time to use energy. This is especially good if you can create a calendar event for free electricity sessions, so people can plan ahead.

Here are the corresponding Home-Assistant automations:

```yaml

## Using a Physical Indicator

Having seen the success of just a simple dashboard, my expectation was that putting a live indicator in the kitchen (the most energy intensive room due to actions) would have an even greater effect. The idea being that you can see in real time what effect turning on an appliance has without having to check your phone. In addition, it can show the battery level, energy price, solar generation and battery overload warnings.

I created my live indicator using ESPHome on an [M5Stack-Atom-Echo](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/atom/atomecho) and some addressable RGB LEDs. The LEDs are split into 4 sections:

1. Nothing yet (obscured by curtain)
2. Battery Level (level shown like a progress bar across the wall, current state shown by animated pixel moving across the LEDs with variable speed) and energy rates (green colour for <0.3p/kWh, red colour for >20p/kWh, otherwise yellow colour)
3. Solar Level (solar generation as a fraction of the capacity shown like a progress bar)
4. Battery Overload Warning (accompanied by a beep)

This setup has slightly improved our costs. I think that this improvement is a product of improved ergonomics and the feeling of guilt felt when you see the battery discharging quickly or you get beeped by the battery overload warning.

Here is my ESPHome configuration:
